# RandomQuotes

This app display inspirational quote randomly. 

User can add thier own favorite quotes. 

This reposition is the frontend part of full stack MERN app that randomly display inspirational quotes. It is inspired from one of my Ruby on Rails project,[Splurty](https://github.com/zenkbaries/Splurty), that I had while I was in [Firehose Project](http://thefirehoseproject.com/).

The backend part is at [basic-mern-backend](https://github.com/zenkbaries/basic-mern-backend). This is where the quotes are stored using MongoDB.

It use [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) authentication service.

## Installation/Usage
------

clone this repository. Go into the cloned directory and install it:

```bash
cd <cloned directory>
npm install
npm start
```
(Instruction on how to configure to use API(backend) and Auth0 will be added here later.)
